    # load data from Excel file
    df = DataHandler.DataHandler(excel_file="<Path to EXCEL DATA FILE>", number_of_frames=number_of_frames).df

    # create canvas object, we will use this to draw our elements to
    canvas = Canvas.canvas()

    # add bar chart
    bar_chart = PieRace.pie_plot(canvas=canvas.canvas, df=df)
    canvas.add_sub_plot(bar_chart)
