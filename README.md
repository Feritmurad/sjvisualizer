Replace <version> with the actual version number of the wheel file.

## Usage
```python
from sjvisualizer import Canvas
from sjvisualizer import DataHandler
from sjvisualizer import PieRace
import time
import json

def main(fps = 60, duration = 0.35):

    number_of_frames = duration*60*fps

    # load data from Excel file
    df = DataHandler.DataHandler(excel_file="<Path to EXCEL DATA FILE>", number_of_frames=number_of_frames).df

    # create canvas object, we will use this to draw our elements to
    canvas = Canvas.canvas()

    # add bar chart
    bar_chart = PieRace.pie_plot(canvas=canvas.canvas, df=df)
    canvas.add_sub_plot(bar_chart)

    # add static text
    canvas.add_title("TITLE", color=(0,132,255))
    canvas.add_sub_title("SUB-TITLE", color=(0,132,255))

    # add time indication
    canvas.add_time(df=df, time_indicator="month")

    canvas.play(fps=fps)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
